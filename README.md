About This Repository

This project is all about LangChain — a framework that helps developers build applications powered by Large Language Models (LLMs).

I’ve always been curious about how these powerful models actually work, so I started exploring and researching the world of AI and language models. Along the way, I discovered LangChain, which connects LLMs with tools, data, and workflows in fascinating ways.

This repository marks my first-ever project on GitHub, created out of pure curiosity and excitement to learn more about AI, prompt engineering, and intelligent systems.
